# nmea__

Parses NMEA sentences from GPS

nmea__ was the start of an NMEA0183 parser that now runs on an STM32F103C8T6 with a Neo 6M Gt-U7 GPS module.
It was meant to just test the parsing logic out on a dummy text file as opposed to a stream of data coming 
in from a GPS module. That project is still under construction, but has come much further than where this left off.

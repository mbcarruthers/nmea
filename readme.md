# nmea 

project is actually called cpl but that doesn't matter. intermediary project. Building an 
NMEA sentence parser for parsing information from NEO-7M GPS module.

Working from Makefile 
currently trying to correctly set NMEA types for objects to either decode on the server side
or decode on the microcontroller side. That is yet to be determined. Either way, this is the code to parse the NMEA sentences
